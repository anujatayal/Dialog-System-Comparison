The study compares two dialog systems—an in-house Neuro-Symbolic System (HFFood-NS) with a GPT-based system (HFFood-GPT)—using a within-subject design. 
We conduct intrinsic (task performance)  and extrinsic analyses using pre- and post-interaction surveys to evaluate the 2 systems with African-American patients while hospitalized.
At the end of the user study, a dataset of approximately 200 conversations was collected (20 patients × 5 food items × 2 models).
